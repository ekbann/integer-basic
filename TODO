UNIT: loop1
    PRINT does not terminate with LF/CR.

UNIT: assignment
    variable "A" crashes ca65 assembler, conflict with cc65 macros
    cc65 treats "A" as accumulator, need to rename variables as "var_A"

+ Need to print FPTEMP from 4 bytes to 8 bytes(?). YES
+ Check functions that uses FPTEMP now using 8 bytes.
+ Verify if Q16.16 needs 64-bit temp storage. YES
+ learn to compile a library and only add used functions to the final code.
DONE + PUSH needs to zero SFL/SFH to avoid FPSTACK garbage.

CONVERT MANTISSA Q16.16 ==> .16 part to INTEGER ==> PrDec16
		PUSH mantissa (16-bit) as an integer
		decimal 10,000 ($2710); largest that fits in 16-bit
        jsr UMUL	; (mantissa * 10000) / (2^16) <-- just the MSW of FP
        mantissa is always UNSIGNED

CONVERT ASCII MANTISSA ==> to .16 part
        ASCII to UNSIGNED INTEGER (normal ATOI)
        Copy mantissa INT to SIL/SIH, zero SFL/SFH == ffff:0000 (32-bit) use FPTEMP
        UDIV by $2710
        Copy LSW (least significant WORD) to SFL/SFH
        therefore... NEED 32-bit DIV 16-bit == 16-bit RESULT

FPMUL32
FP (32-bit) x FP (32-bit) = 64-bit FPTEMP ==> 8 bytes
iiii.ffff x iiii.ffff = aaaa.bbbb:cccc.cccc
result = bbbb:cccc
