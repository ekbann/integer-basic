UNIT: loop1
    PRINT does not terminate with LF/CR.

UNIT: assignment
    variable "A" crashes ca65 assembler, conflict with cc65 macros
    cc65 treats "A" as accumulator, need to rename variables as "var_A"

+ Need to print FPTEMP from 4 bytes to 8 bytes(?). YES
+ Check functions that uses FPTEMP now using 8 bytes.
+ Verify if Q16.16 needs 64-bit temp storage. YES
+ learn to compile a library and only add used functions to the final code.
DONE + PUSH needs to zero SFL/SFH to avoid FPSTACK garbage.

CONVERT MANTISSA Q16.16 ==> .16 part to INTEGER ==> PrDec16
		PUSH mantissa (16-bit) as an integer
		decimal 10,000 ($2710); largest that fits in 16-bit
        jsr UMUL	; (mantissa * 10000) / (2^16) <-- just the MSW of FP
        mantissa is always UNSIGNED

CONVERT ASCII MANTISSA ==> to .16 part
        ASCII to UNSIGNED INTEGER (normal ATOI)
        Copy mantissa INT to SIL/SIH, zero SFL/SFH == ffff:0000 (32-bit) use FPTEMP
        UDIV by $2710
        Copy LSW (least significant WORD) to SFL/SFH
        therefore... NEED 32-bit DIV 16-bit == 16-bit RESULT

FPMUL32
FP (32-bit) x FP (32-bit) = 64-bit FPTEMP ==> 8 bytes
iiii.ffff x iiii.ffff = aaaa.bbbb:cccc.cccc
result = bbbb:cccc

=== from intro remarks ===

MUL8(): 8-bit integer multiplication, result is 2-bytes
DIV8(): 8-bit integer division, result is 2-bytes
MOD8(): 8-bit integer modulo, result is 2-bytes
MUL() : 32-bit fixed-point multiplication (Woz's) 4-bytes, 16-bit:16-bit
DIV() : 32-bit fixed-point division (Woz's) 4-bytes, 16-bit:16-bit
FMUL(): 32-bit floating-point multiplication (Woz's) 4-bytes
FDIV(): 32-bit floating-point division (Woz's) 4-bytes
LOG,LN,ATN,COS,SIN,SQR,TAN,PI

Add Zero Page variables
Add r0-r15 16-bit registers
Add .B suffix for unsigned byte (normal VAR is 16-bit)
Add ADD8(), SUB8(), MUL8() and DIV8() for .B
Add support for hexadecimals $ff5c
BASIC V2 commands: CHR$,GET,TIME,ASC

DIM: Re-dimension of a pre-existing A$; memory problems
