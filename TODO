U32DIV16: .Y is used for temporary byte storage.
    use a memory location instead and use .Y (or .X) for FPSP index == smaller code
    + optimize U32DIV16: avoid copying TOS to FPTEMP and back

PrFP32: maybe convert it to print from r0/r1 like PrDec16 prints from r0 (but copies to r11)

UNIT: loop1
    PRINT does not terminate with LF/CR when using ',' separator.

UNIT: assignment
    variable "A" crashes ca65 assembler, conflict with cc65 macros
    cc65 treats "A" as accumulator, need to rename variables as "var_A"
    "Use of identifiers consisting of a single character will not work in all cases, because some of these identifiers are reserved keywords (for example "A" is not a valid identifier for a label, because it is the keyword for the accumulator)."

+ learn to compile a library and only add used functions to the final code.

FPMUL32
FP (32-bit) x FP (32-bit) = 64-bit FPTEMP ==> 8 bytes (really need 8 bytes?)
iiii.ffff x iiii.ffff = aaaa.bbbb:cccc.cccc
result = bbbb:cccc

Add Zero Page variables
Add r0-r15 16-bit registers
Add .B suffix for unsigned byte (normal VAR is 16-bit)
Add ADD8(), SUB8(), MUL8() and DIV8() for .B
Add support for hexadecimals $ff5c
BASIC V2 commands: CHR$,GET,TIME,ASC
Add FP command to run BASIC in SIGNED Q16.16 FIXED-POINT MODE otherwise runs in SIGNED 16-bit INTEGER MODE

DONE: URGENT: PrDec16 pads with 5 '0' which breaks PrFP32 because it needs '0000' and '0000'
        and PrDec16Lp1 does NOT work as it should... ldy #6 ==> 4 digits
        call PrDec16 but changing line 3 to:
                LDY #6			; Offset to powers of ten
        works!!! prints decimal with 4 places padding with '0'. WHY?

DONE: PUSH needs to zero SFL/SFH to avoid FPSTACK garbage.

DONE: CONVERT MANTISSA Q16.16 ==> .16 part to INTEGER ==> PrDec16
		PUSH mantissa (16-bit) as an integer
		decimal 10,000 ($2710); largest that fits in 16-bit
        jsr UMUL	; (mantissa * 10000) / (2^16) <-- just the MSW of FP
        mantissa is always UNSIGNED
        REPEAT to extend 4 decimals '9999' to 8 decimals '99999999'

DONE:   CONVERT ASCII MANTISSA ==> to .16 part
        ASCII to UNSIGNED INTEGER (normal ATOI)
        Copy mantissa INT to SIL/SIH, zero SFL/SFH == ffff:0000 (32-bit) use FPTEMP
        UDIV by $2710
        Copy LSW (least significant WORD) to SFL/SFH
        therefore... NEED 32-bit DIV 16-bit == 16-bit RESULT

DONE: ATOFP is buggy because it can only process 4 digits in the mantissa at a time!
    3.14159 => "14,159" overflows the "9,999" limit
    PrFP32 works by printing "xxxx" twice (two UMUL $2710)
    but ATOFP needs work... reverse PrFP32 and undo twice with mantissa text processed:
    0-4 chars = pad to 8 char string; "aaaa0000"
    5-8 chars = pad to 8 char string; "aaaabbbb"; e.g. "14159000"
    start undoing "bbbb" = "9000":
        9000:0000 / 10000 = "0000:xxxx" where xxxx is the LSW for the next round
    start undoing "aaaa" = "1415":
        1415:xxxx / 10000 = "0000:yyyy" where yyyy is the ORIGINAL mantissa for .14159000

DONE:   Need to print FPTEMP from 4 bytes to 8 bytes(?). NO, algo doesnt need
        Verify if Q16.16 needs 64-bit temp storage. NO
