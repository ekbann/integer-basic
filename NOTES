# Implementation Notes:

Integer BASIC's string handling was based on the system in HP BASIC. This
treated string variables as arrays of characters which had to be DIMed prior
to use. This is similar to the model in C or Fortran 77. This is in contrast
to MS-like BASICs where strings are an intrinsic variable-length type. Before
MS-derived BASICs became the de facto standard, this style was not uncommon;
North Star BASIC and Atari BASIC used the same concept, as did others.

Strings in Integer Basic used a fixed amount of memory regardless of the
number of characters used within them, up to a maximum of 255 characters.
This had the advantage of avoiding the need for the garbage collection of the
heap that was notoriously slow in MS BASIC but meant that strings that
were shorter than the declared length was wasted.

Integer BASIC, as its name implies, uses signed integers as the basis for its
math package. These were stored internally as a 16-bit number, little-endian (as
is the 6502). This allowed a maximum value for any calculation between -32767
and 32767. No fraction, just QUOTIENT (/) and REMAINDER (MOD).

Only single-dimension arrays were allowed, limited in size only by the available
memory.

Integer BASIC used the parameter in RND(6) which returned an integer from 0 to 5.

The position of the controller could be read using the PDL function, passing
in the controller number, 0 or 1, like A=PDL(0):PRINT A, returning a value
between 0 and 255.

A=SCRN(X,Y) returned the color of the screen at X,Y.

Integer BASIC included a POP command to exit from loops. This popped the
topmost item off the FOR stack. Atari BASIC also supported the same command,
while North Star BASIC used EXIT.

Although Integer BASIC contained its own math routines, the Apple II ROMs
also included a complete floating-point library located in ROM memory between
$F425-F4FB and $F63D-F65D. The source code was included in the Apple II
manual. BASIC programs requiring floating-point calculations could CALL into
these routines.

The noun stack and syntax stack appear to overlap, which is OK since
they apparently are not used simultaneously. The noun stack size appears
to be 32 entries.

        Noun stack usage appears to be:
            integer: value
            string: pointer to string

GOSUB stack, max eight entries, note that the Apple II version has sixteen entries.

FOR stack, max eight entries, note that the Apple II version has sixteen entries.

ASCII  32 ($20) = SPACE
ASCII 160 ($A0) = Non-breaking SPACE (32 + 128, hight bit set). EOL last character is unset.
TAB does horizontal tab by printing ASCII 160
